Barista Bliss Cafe Menu App
Welcome to Barista Bliss, a React Native mobile application designed for managing and browsing a cafe menu. 
This app provides an intuitive interface for customers to explore beverages, main meals,    
and desserts while allowing cafe staff to manage menu items efficiently.
Technical Implementation
Built with React Native and TypeScript, the app leverages React Navigation for seamless screen transitions. The stack navigator handles navigation between the welcome screen,
home screen, add item form, and filter view. State management
is handled through React hooks, with useState maintaining the menu items list throughout the app lifecycle.
